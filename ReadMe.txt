Idea: Vending Machine App (to be renamed or not to be renamed, that is the question. Vendapp?)

Main function -locate on an integrated map where vending machines are

Sub functions -filter on what the vending machine sells (bread, meat, beverages ...)
	      -locate closest vending machine
	      -favorite machine
	      -able to check details of a vending machine
	      -user reviews and ratings?

Mobile specific -scan a qr code to check details of vending machine (if for example it's empty
		-offline access to the map with the vending machine locations
